VHD: Viscous HydroDynamics
by: Jonathan C. McKinney & Charles F. Gammie

Description:

This code evolves the equations of hydrodynamics including a viscous stress parameterized by alpha to simulate disk accretion around a black hole.

Code:

global.h : contains most global parameters to control the simulation, function declarations, etc.
--: To change the problem size, datatype, viscous tensor components, terms to use in pressure/gravity function, turn on/off diagnostics, or add new function declarations

defs.h : contains definitions of variables
timestep1.h : timestep limiter calculations
timestep2.h : like (1) above, but no courant factor, for analysis of time scales
===
main.c: main loop, runtime diagnostics
init.c: initializes the code
--: analoutput chooses type of problem used in analsol.c, can turn on/off various physics terms, modify viscosity initialization, etc.
analsol.c: initializes the physics
--: analsol.c contains the injection and torus IC, and all specific parameters to this problem setup
step.c: physics code
sweep.c: advection code
timestep.c: timestep code
bound.c: boundary value code
diag.c: diagnostics
numerics.c: numerical details, non-physics
ranc.c: numerical recipies randomizer
utilfun.c: utility functions

===
Example compile and run:

make
cd bin
./twod
